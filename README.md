# Eyes
## Exercise on eyes
<img src="Eyes.png" width='300'/>
This exercise demonstrates two eyes that follow the movement of a mouse. I've brought together Javascript and CSS to dynamically manipulate styles on a web page.

To run this on your machine, you'll need all of these files and you'll need to load the .html file onto your browser.
<br></br>
Additional functionality that would be helpful to a user for future iterations would be to add a graphic with occasional blinking eyes.
