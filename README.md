This exercise demonstrates two eyes that follow the movement of a mouse. I've brought together Javascript and CSS to dynamically manipulate styles on a web page.

To run this on your machine, you'll need all of these files and you'll need to load the .html file onto your browser.

Additional functionality that would be helpful to a user for future iterations would be to add a graphic with occasional blinking eyes.
